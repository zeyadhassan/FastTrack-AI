# FastTrack AI - VS Code Extension

FastTrack AI is a VS Code extension that helps you track, analyze, and maintain AI-generated code in your projects. It silently monitors code insertions from tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, analyzes their quality, and gives you insights to ensure your codebase remains maintainable.

## Features

### üîç AI Code Detection

FastTrack AI automatically detects when code is generated by AI tools such as:

- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Other AI coding assistants (manual tagging)

It adds a subtle comment tag to mark AI-generated code sections and keeps track of these blocks in a local graph database.

### üìä Interactive Dashboard

View comprehensive metrics about your AI-assisted development:

- AI code usage over time
- Test coverage for AI-generated code
- Complexity analysis of AI suggestions
- Files with high AI concentration
- Stale AI code that hasn't been modified

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Detection

Identify potential issues before they become problems:

- Untested AI-generated code
- Overly complex AI suggestions
- Duplicate functionality
- Stale code blocks

### üß™ Test Coverage Tracking

Keep your AI-generated code well-tested:

- Track which AI code blocks have tests
- Easily see untested AI code
- Generate test templates for untested blocks

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the FastTrack AI extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. The extension will automatically initialize a `.fasttrack` directory in your project
3. Start coding with your preferred AI assistants

### Using the Extension

**Toggle Tracking**:
- Click the FastTrack AI icon in the status bar to enable/disable tracking
- Alternatively, use the command `FastTrack AI: Toggle Code Tracking`

**View Dashboard**:
- Run the command `FastTrack AI: Open Dashboard`
- Or click "Open Dashboard" in the FastTrack AI sidebar

**Analyze Your Workspace**:
- Run the command `FastTrack AI: Analyze Workspace` to scan existing code
- This will detect and tag AI-generated code throughout your project

**Manually Tag Code**:
- Select a block of code
- Right-click and choose "FastTrack AI: Tag Selection as AI-Generated"
- Select which AI tool generated the code

## Sidebar Views

FastTrack AI adds a dedicated sidebar to VS Code with three views:

1. **Status** - Overview of AI usage in your project
2. **AI Code Files** - Files containing AI-generated code
3. **Untested AI Code** - AI code blocks without tests

## Configuration

Customize FastTrack AI through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "fasttrack-ai.trackingEnabled": true,
  "fasttrack-ai.aiTools": ["copilot", "cursor"],
  "fasttrack-ai.complexityThreshold": 10,
  "fasttrack-ai.staleAfterDays": 30
}
```

## How It Works

FastTrack AI operates with minimal impact on your workflow:

1. **Detection**: When you accept an AI suggestion, FastTrack AI detects the insertion
2. **Tagging**: The code is tagged with a comment and recorded in the graph
3. **Analysis**: Complexity and quality metrics are calculated
4. **Tracking**: Test coverage and modifications are monitored over time
5. **Insights**: The dashboard visualizes patterns and highlights potential issues

All data is stored locally in the `.fasttrack` directory of your project.

## For Teams

FastTrack AI is designed to help teams work effectively with AI tools:

- **Non-punitive**: Focuses on insights, not restrictions
- **Local-first**: All data stays within your project
- **Version control friendly**: Graph data can be committed to track AI usage over time
- **Collaboration-friendly**: Team members can see which parts of the codebase use AI
